# reARrity-demo
Testing htlm5 based AR with different markers.
Those markers are printed in 841x841 scale. So models can look little weird on small class and animated 3D model on "FIVR" is based on the floor, so it's from unicorn upward view.
Just navigate to www.rearity.com/expo and look markers through your phone/tablet.
